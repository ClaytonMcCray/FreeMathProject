# FreeMathProject
The Free Math Project: creating a FOSS library for advanced mathematical programming.

As the description states, this a project to make mathematical computing less opaque and less
bound to specific integrated environments -- looking at you, MATLAB. Basically, the goal is
to write a mathematics library in pure Python. The major issue here is obvious: speed. I think, though,
that in many cases, slowing down the speed of computation is an acceptable price to pay for more clarity
in the code base and for more development options. And if gaps need to be filled, SciPy can plug them while
maintaining pythonic integrity.
